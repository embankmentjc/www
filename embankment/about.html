                    <p>The first steam ferry service in the world began in 1812 when Robert Fulton traveled between Jersey City and Manhattan. </p>
                    <p>In the 1830s, the Morris Canal brought Pennsylvania coal into Jersey City. One of the earliest railroads in the country, the New Jersey Railroad, was also established. </p>
                    <p>Emergent regional railroads, grown powerful through takeover, lease, and aggregation, competed for access to New York. These lines changed the shape of Jersey City, cutting through the Palisades, filling in marshes, running tracks over city streets.  Railyards covered the waterfront.  The Pennsylvania Station here was at one time the largest in the world. </p>

                        <p class="offset-md-top-66">By the time the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) was chartered (1846), the proliferation of railroads had shown that the future was rail. By 1882, the dynamic PRR had become the world’s largest railroad. Around the turn of the 19th-20th centuries, the PRR had more than 10,000 route miles, millions of passengers, and revenue second only to that of the federal government.  The PRR called itself “The Standard Railway of the World,” and was known for its management, engineering, service quality, and design.</p>

                        <p>Focused first on routes connecting the Philadelphia port to Pittsburgh and points west, the PRR turned its focus eastward during the Civil War. Acquiring leases for the United Canal and Railroad Companies route to Jersey City in 1871, the PRR gained direct access to the major port of New York. By 1910 it had built tunnels under the Hudson and East Rivers into New York, connected its main line with the Long Island Rail Road, and opened a grand passenger station in midtown Manhattan.</p>

                    <h3>The PRR in Jersey City </h3>
                    <p>The Pennsylvania Railroad was a large presence in Jersey City for more than a hundred years. It dominated the waterfront, changed the landscape, and especially shaped the Downtown neighborhoods.</p>
                    <p>Because the Hudson River was a great barrier to rail, early stations serving New York were built in Jersey City. The second Pennsylvania Station built at Exchange Place, Jersey City, in 1891 was the world’s largest terminal, and enabled passengers arriving by rail to move directly onto ferries without going outside.</p>
                    <div class="offset-top-20">
                        <p>The Harsimus Branch freight way (c. 1877) diverged from the PRR main line at Waldo Avenue to better handle burgeoning freight into Harsimus Yards. Embankment construction 1901-5 expanded its capacity. </p>
                        <p>After 1910, when Pennsylvania Station opened in New York, Jersey City passenger service dwindled. Freight also declined. In 1946, the PRR reported a loss in revenue for the first time. By 1963 the Exchange Place terminal was demolished.  The grand Beaux-Arts New York station suffered a similar fate, but its loss sparked preservation activism that has extended to other historically significant PRR sites, including the Harsimus Branch.</p>

                    <h3>Nation's Largest Terminal</h3>
                    <p>The Pennsylvania Station was an intermodal passenger terminal, part of the Pennsylvania Railroad’s holdings on the Hudson River in Jersey City. The terminal was located on the 1812 site of the first landing of the first steam ferry service in the world, and at which rail service began in 1834. The station was the terminus of the PRR main line running down Railroad Avenue, now Christopher Columbus Drive, to what is now Exchange Place.</p>
                    <div class="offset-top-20">
                        <p>In 1873 the railroad terminal was damaged by fire and the PRR hired Architect Charles Conrad Schneider to design a grand and elaborate replacement. Modeled after a terminal in Frankfort am Main, Germany, the seven-story Pennsylvania Station was built in 1891 and completed in 1892.  It was the largest terminal in the United States at the time. The arched roof of the building had a single span of 250 feet.</p>

                    <h3>New York City Tunnel</h3>
                    <p>The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) consolidated its control of railroads in New Jersey with the lease of United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company in 1871. At that time PRR considered a proposal for a bridge to Manhattan but rejected it. An alternative was to tunnel under the Hudson River, but tunnels were not feasible for steam locomotives. The development of the electric locomotive at the turn of the century made a tunnel practical. In 1901, PRR President Alexander Cassatt announced a plan to enter New York City by tunneling under the Hudson and building a grand station on the West Side of Manhattan south of 34th Street.</p>
                    <div class="offset-top-20">
                        <p>The 1910 opening of the PRR tunnels led to a substantial reduction in PRR traffic to Jersey City. In 1911, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, a rapid transit system, began operating over the PRR line west of Waldo Yard, connecting with the new Manhattan Transfer station at Harrison. Ferry service at the Jersey City terminal ended in 1949 and the last PRR passenger train used used the main line to Exchange Place in November 1961.</p>

                    <h3>Public Transit Connections</h3>
                    <p>After the turn of the 20th century, electric trolley cars owned by the Public Service Company ran from the Pennsylvania Station at Exchange Place in Jersey City, taking passengers south to Bayonne and to other parts of Hudson County. The Public Service depot was next to the Pennsylvania Railroad ferry slip, had a large covered shed, and sheltered several trolley lines for the city. This public transportation infrastructure was critical to support the sharp growth in Jersey City's population, largely fueled by immigration, at the time.</p>
                    <div class="offset-top-20">
                        <p>A century later, Jersey City is experiencing similar population growth. Public transportation plays a critical role in supporting this growth. Jersey City has already re-introduced electric light rail to its urban infrastructure. It is critical that Jersey City keeps in place historic railroad rights-of-way in order to enhance current and accommodate future public transportation options.</p>

                        <p class="offset-md-top-66">The Harsimus Branch separated from the Pennsylvania Railroad main line near Waldo Avenue in Jersey City. A two-track line traversed the edge of the Harsimus Cemetery and, to address a grade change from the Palisades to marshy areas below, ran over trestles past an ash dump transformed into a park (Mary Benson Park), then crossed Newark Avenue and continued to Brunswick Street and east along Sixth Street to the Harsimus Yards.</p>

                        <p>The freight line also connected to a spur of the New Jersey Junction Railroad just before reaching Brunswick Street, allowing waterfront freight to be moved north at the base of the Palisades to other rail systems.</p>

                        <p>When in 1905 the massive stone Embankment was completed, it expanded the number of tracks from Brunswick east to seven. These funneled into five tracks as the line crossed Henderson Street (current Marin Boulevard) and headed southeast into the Harsimus Yards. </p>

                    <p>The Harsimus Branch and other rail lines terminated along low-lying Jersey City waterfront. By 1870 much of this area was filled in to accommodate the lines and associated warehouses, stockyards, and industries. As shown in adjacent maps, the city’s coastline was drastically changed in a short period of time. </p>
                    <p>Three elevated lines rose over Downtown Jersey City streets to address changes in topography and to protect the public from trains running at grade.  These lines defined Hamilton Park, Harsimus Cove, and Van Vorst Park neighborhoods. From north to south were the Erie at 10th Street, the Pennsylvania Railroad Harsimus Branch at 6th, and the main line of the Pennsylvania at Rail Road Avenue (now Christopher Columbus Drive). The Harsimus Yards lay between the two PRR lines.</p>
                    <div class="offset-top-20">
                        <p>The Harsimus Branch was almost at grade at the Hudson waterfront, rising from 13 to 27 feet on the Embankment segments on 6th Street, continuing on trestles until the tracks reached an abutment on the Palisades, then running at grade at the edge of the Harsimus Cemetery, gradually descending into the Bergen Cut near Waldo Avenue.</p>

Some 800-plus workers were employed at the Harsimus Yards at its peak; this number may have been possible because of European immigration. At a time when most people walked to work, it must be assumed that an increasing portion of the local population worked at the nearby Yards, or at the rail-related warehouses and express companies in the adjacent Warehouse district.</p>

                    <p>The Embankment replaced an earlier elevated iron freight way that was planned in the late 1860s and constructed in the mid-1870s.

                    <p>After rail traffic on the Harsimus Branch ended, tracks from all Embankment segments and trestles to the west were removed, as well as most signaling, switching and watering systems. Regularly spaced metal flats remain attached to the upper surface of the coping along much of the northern Embankment retaining wall. All plate girder bridges joining the Embankment segments were removed in 1996 and chain link fencing was attached to the coping at north-south cross-streets.</p>

                        <p>The right-of-way is still clearly delineated, however, and enjoys protections through its eligibility for the State and National Registers of Historic Places, as does the Embankment structure. When Conrail sold a segment of the Branch in 2005, the Embankment Preservation Coalition joined with the City of Jersey City and Rails to Trails Conservancy in litigation aimed at preserving the historic Branch for public uses of rail, trail, and open space.</p>

                    <p>The Embankment Preservation Coalition formed in 1998 as a working group that evolved from meetings of more than a hundred neighbors concerned about a proposal to demolish the Harsimus Branch Embankment and develop the site, which is located in Downtown Jersey City and forms the boundary of two National Historic Districts.</p>

                    <p>The group spent months researching the historic, environmental, aesthetic, and cultural aspects of this structure. Findings led to a consensus that the Embankment is an important and irreplaceable historic, environmental, and transportation resource that must be preserved.  A nonprofit organized in 1999 to preserve the Embankment structure and reuse the Branch for multiple public purposes.</p>

Cunningham. The Embankment was listed in the State Register of Historic Places in 1999, determined eligible for listing on the National Register in 2000, and was declared a Municipal Landmark in January 2003. Following a court challenge, it was once again landmarked in 2006. <br><br>
